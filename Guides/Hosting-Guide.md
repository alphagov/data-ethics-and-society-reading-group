Hosting Guide
================

This can help hosts of the book club events - especially useful if you
rotate hosts, have multiple locations or online meetings.

Hosts should also adhere to the Facilitator Guide.

  - Tell community this is a safe space:
      - to explore ideas and opinions.
      - Everyone should listen actively with a **generous and open
        mind**
      - do not interrupt or criticise others,
      - consciously aim to help everyone to speak for roughly equal time
      - If anyone feels uncomfortable at any time do speak with
        \[**Hillary**\]
