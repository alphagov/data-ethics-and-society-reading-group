# How to run a Data Ethics Club meeting

As with much of this repository, the below borrows heavily from [Data Ethics Club](https://github.com/very-good-science/data-ethics-club).

Typically we have a brief introduction to the material, split everyone into breakout rooms of 5-6 people for 25-30 minutes to talk about the discussion questions, and then come back together for the final 15-20 minutes to share thoughts before voting on the material for the next meeting.

## Roles and getting involved

We tend to have separate responsibilities split into facilitating and organising, and we swap these roles around each meeting.  
The **facilitator** is responsible for leading on the content,  managing the discussion in the meeting and writing up the summary of the meeting.  
The **organiser** is responsible for sending out emails, setting up the templates and managing participants and breakout rooms in the meeting.  

### I'd like to be an organiser of Data Ethics Club

We'd would love to hear from people interested in organising! Please [reach out on Slack](https://govdatascience.slack.com/team/U01BSUWU0UE) and let us know. We'd especially like to hear from people who are new to the Civil Service and from groups usually under-represented in data science.

### I'd like to lead a session on a particular topic

Brilliant! Please [reach out on Slack](https://govdatascience.slack.com/team/U01BSUWU0UE) to let us know and we can set this up with you.

## Before the meeting

### For facilitators

- [ ] Choose the material to discuss from the [reading list](./../READING-LIST.md). We suggest voting on this in the previous meeting!  
- [ ] Decide on three questions around the piece to discuss.  
- [ ] Create a [meeting information file](./../Sessions/session-template.md) in the `Sessions/` folder with links and the three discussion questions.
- [ ] Have a 3-minute verbal summary of the material ready in case nobody in the meeting is prepared to volunteer one.  

### For organisers

- [ ] Update the [meeting overview file](./../SESSIONS.md) with a link to the new meeting information page.
- [ ] Send a one-week reminder to the group with quick links to the online meeting, the reading material and the discussion questions. We usually also include a link to last week's discussion.
- [ ] Send an on-the-day reminder to the group with quick links to the online meeting, the reading material and the discussion questions.  
- [ ] Make sure you have three choices from the reading list for attendees to vote on for the next meeting. You can make this decision  in advance, together with the facilitator or other organisers (see [organising](../organising.md) for some ideas on making these decisions).

## Meeting Structure

Meetings are typically 1 hour.  
  
**0-5 mins**
  ðŸŸ¢ Allow people to trickle in and say hi.
  - You can use this time to link to the HackMD document and let people introduce themselves there.

**5-10 mins**
  ðŸ‘‹ Welcome everyone to the meeting.
  - Once everyone has arrived, invite a 3 minute summary of the content for discussion (not everyone will have had a chance to read it). If no one volunteers you may need to do this yourself!
  - Post a link to the Code of Conduct. If there are new people, you can ask people to use the "put hand up" feature to answer if they read the paper this week. This is an opportunity to check if people can use the feature and a reminder to make space for people to talk. 
  - Allocate people randomly into breakout rooms, with 5-6 people in each group.

**10-40 mins**  
  ðŸ’¬ Everyone chats in their breakout rooms. Keep an eye on the main room for any latecomers who need to be assigned to a breakout room.  

**40-55 mins**  
  ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ Bring everyone back to the main room and invite summaries from each group.
  Hopefully this will provoke some discussion (we usually find we run out of time because of it!).
  The facilitator should chair this part of the meeting to make sure that all groups get a chance to feed back.

**55-60 mins**  
  ðŸ“Š Run a feedback poll.
  We usually ask:  
  - Did the material provoke interesting discussion?
  - Would you recommend this piece to another group?  
  - Vote on what to discuss next time (from a shortlist).

## After the meeting

- [ ] Update the meeting information file with the outcome of the poll and a link to the summary document.  
- [ ] Move the meeting on the overall meeting list, and make the next one!
