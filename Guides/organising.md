# How we organise the Data Science: Ethics & Society Reading Group

As with much of this repository, the below borrows heavily from [Data Ethics Club](https://github.com/very-good-science/data-ethics-club).

We've described how a typical meeting would run in the ['Facilitating'](./facilitating.md) document, and so this document is more about how people can contribute to the repository, and how we operate more generally.

## Deciding on material to read

The [reading list](./../READING-LIST.md) is organised into lots of different sections - some are philosophical, some are technical. Our [previously discussed pieces are available in our Sessions Overview](./../SESSIONS.md). We like to check off things we have discussed [in the reading list](./../READING-LIST.md), and include a link to the meeting info page which summarises the content.  

To decide on material to read the organisers pick three pieces from the list based on recent suggestions, and then the whole group votes on these for the following meeting.

We try to consider the following when picking what to put to the vote each week:
    - If someone recently said they'd like it to make the list
    - If there is a reason to prioritise looking a particular piece soon, for example if there is a deadline for feedback, or if something is a preprint or recent paper that would benefit from being looked at soon.
    - If there are certain topics that missed out on being discussed due to the group make-up, (whether these relate to particular protected characteristics, e.g. disability, race, gender) or types of scholarship (e.g. data science keeps winning in votes over social science), then consider having a themed meeting, where all three choices are all within that category, to ensure we get a chance to discuss it.

It's useful to prepare a very short (1-2 sentence) summary about each piece of content to introduce it to the group, so that they know what they're voting for.

## Contributing

### How can I contribute to the reading list?

Since we organise around a GitHub repository people can submit issues using our issue template. People can also submit pull requests, or simply send us a Slack message and we upload their suggestions on to the repository - we know not everyone is comfortable using GitHub!

### How do we acknowledge contributions?

Contributions can be lots of different things, and so we use [All Contributors](https://allcontributors.org/) to capture a variety of contribution types. These include suggesting material, fixing broken links, organising and producing artwork. To suit our purposes we're using the [emoji key](#all-contributors-emoji-key) adapted by [Data Ethics Club](https://github.com/very-good-science/data-ethics-club) with some slight changes.  

#### Using the all-contributors bot

TO DO: check use of bot

All Contributors provides a GitHub bot that makes it easy to add new contributors.
To use it, comment in an issue or pull-request something like:  

```markdown
@all-contributors please add @NatalieThurlby for organising  
```

The bot will then set up a pull-request (PR) to add the named person to the contributors list, and the PR will update the list of contributors at the bottom. We are in the process of setting up an open issue that we use to call the all-contributors bot. TO DO: open issue

Some people aren't on GitHub of course, so to add them to the contributions list you can manually edit the file `.all-contributorsrc` by adding the following object to the list:  

```
    {
      "login": "",
      "name": "FirstName SecondName",
      "avatar_url": "https://www.example.com/profile-pic.jpg",
      "profile": "https://mywebsite.com",
      "contributions": [
        "content"
      ]
    },
```

This person's contribution will then show up the next time you use the bot to add someone to the repo.  

#### All Contributers emoji key

The slightly edited emoji key that we use is:

üñã (content) for submitting suggestions to the "reading" list (suggestions can be any medium!)  
üí¨ (question) for leading the discussion in a meeting  
üìù (blog) for writing in the HackMD in a meeting  
üìã (eventOrganising) for organising  
ü§î (ideas) for ideas and planning of the group  
üé® (design) for visual design (e.g. logo)  
üöá (infrastructure) for infrastructure (e.g. bots, CI)  
üöß (maintenance) for repository maintenance (e.g. fixing links)  

## Communicating

We primarily use a free [Slack](https://slack.com/) Workspace to communicate with interested Data Science practioners across government. We are developed templates to use for Slack communications and are open to suggestions of how to communicate in a more automated and streamlined fashion!

### Tips for communication

- Using a reusable Teams link simplifies things for us and attendees. TO DO: check if we can do this
- Providing multiple avenues for communication helps us get lots of different types of feedback (e.g. GitHub issues, Slack, even Twitter!)
