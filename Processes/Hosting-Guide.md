Book Club Hosting Guide
================

This can help hosts of the book club events - especially useful if you
rotate hosts, have multiple locations or online meetings.

Hosts should also adhere to the Facilitator Guide.

### Opening the Event

  - Intro to the reading group, cross-government data science community, and why we are interested in ethics
  - Welcome from the hosts
  - Reminder of the topic and materials
  - Reminder of others: DataKind UK (and their [upcoming event](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/online-data-science-ethics-book-club-11-data-and-social-change-movements-tickets-113751574020))
  - Tell community this is a safe space:
      - to explore ideas and opinions.
      - Everyone should listen actively with a **generous and open
        mind**
      - do not interrupt or criticise others,
      - consciously aim to help everyone to speak for roughly equal time
      - If anyone feels uncomfortable at any time do speak with
        \[**Hillary**\]
      - Chatham House
        [rules](https://www.chathamhouse.org/chatham-house-rule)
  - Signpost people to the relevant group
  - Point out the facilitators
  - Ask people to put thoughts on Twitter \[**govethicsbookclub**\] but
    paraphrase what people say if needed, as it is Chatham House
  - There'll be a break in the middle (go round and remind the groups of
    this at \[xpm\]) 

### End

  - Ask participants if anyone would like to write a blog about the book
    club around the questions discussed
  - Let everyone know about the next book club
  - Let us know
      - If you would like to facilitate
      - If you have ideas about future topics
  - We will send out a feedback survey.
