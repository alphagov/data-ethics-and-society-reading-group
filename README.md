# Data Ethics and Society Reading Group

_“Data Science isn’t neutral”_; books such as Race After Technology, Invisible Woman and Data Feminism have highlighted the social and ethical impact of Statistics, Data Science and Artificial intelligence.

The Data Science and Ethics Society reading group is a space for public sector colleagues to reflect on the ethical implication of our work in response to research.
We meet monthly to focus on topic and supplementary research list. The sessions start with a lightening talk summary of three of the readings. Followed by semi-structured breakout out room discussions.
