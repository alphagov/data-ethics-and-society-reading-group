# Data Science: Ethics & Society Reading Group

Built off of, inspired by, and borrowing **heavily** from [Ethics Book Club in a
Box](https://github.com/DataKind-UK/data-ethics-book-club-in-a-box) from
[DataKind UK](https://datakind.org.uk/): an intro to setting up a data ethics book club.

---


Centered around [Data Feminism](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/) by
Catherine D'Ignazio ([@kanarinka](https://twitter.com/kanarinka)) and Lauren Klein ([@laurenfklein](https://twitter.com/laurenfklein)), this reading group intends to broaden and
challenge our understanding of data ethics and its place in our Data Practice across government. 

The aims of the book club, adapted from DataKind UK, are:

1.  To foster discussions of ethics issues among our data science
    community, that we can take back to our day jobs/careers;
2.  To critically evaluate definitions of data for good;
3.  To educate and inform our community on ethical issues, to better
    enable them to advocate for data ethics and data justice within the wider community; and
4.  To strengthen our community of "data for good" enthusiasts.
