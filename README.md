# Data Science: Ethics & Society Reading Group
Built off of, inspired by, and borrowing **heavily** from [Ethics Book Club in a
Box](https://github.com/DataKind-UK/data-ethics-book-club-in-a-box) from
[DataKind UK](https://datakind.org.uk/): an intro to setting up a data ethics
book club.
================

Centered around [Data Feminism](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/) by
Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein, this reading group intends to challenge
our existing Data Practice across government. 

The aims of the book club, adapted from DataKind UK, are:

1.  To foster discussions of ethics issues among our data science
    community, and later on, the wider data science community, that they
    can take back to their day jobs/careers;
2.  To critically evaluate definitions of data for good;
3.  To educate and inform our community on ethical issues, to better
    enable them to advocate for data ethics and data justice within the wider community; and
4.  To strengthen our community of data for good enthusiasts.
