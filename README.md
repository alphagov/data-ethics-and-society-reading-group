# Data Ethics and Society Reading Group

_“Data Science isn’t neutral”;_ books such as Race After Technology, Invisible Woman and Data Feminism have highlighted the social and ethical impact of Statistics, Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (AI).

The Data Science and Ethics Society reading group is a space for public sector colleagues to reflect on the ethical implication of our work in response to research.

### 15-30-15 model

For more information on how to host an event please see the [Hosting Guide](Guides/Hosting-Guide.md). A typical approach for an hour session would be a 15-20-15 model as decsribed below. Note, times can be adjusted if there are fewer than three speakers, or a large attendance with lots of rooms, for example.

#### 15

The sessions start with up to three lightning talks, each a maximum of five minutes. Talks may cover an interesting research paper, application, blog post, anything that fits to the theme of the session. Please refer to the [Lightning Talk Guide](Guides/Lightning-Talk-Guide.md) for more information.

#### 30

These talks are then followed by semi-structured breakout out room discussions. The size of the rooms is up to you, but they should not be too large that people aren't able to contribute. Note though, some people may not want to contribute. To allow for time for everyone to talk you may want to adopt a 1-2 approach, where someone gets one minute to raise a point and everyone gets two minutes to respond. This should be a loose guide and not used to limit discussions though. If you do use this method, 10 people in a room would only get one minute each to talk about a point *they* want to talk about. Please refer to the [Facilitator Guide](Guides/Facilitator-Guide.md) for more information.

#### 15

Everyone should be given the opportunity to regroup and to raise any discussion points, if they wish to. Some may not want to. Again, the 1-2 method may be used. The organisers should close the session, providing guidance on how to continue to discussions going forward.
