# Data Science: Ethics & Society Reading Group

Built off of, inspired by, and borrowing **heavily** from [Ethics Book Club in a
Box](https://github.com/DataKind-UK/data-ethics-book-club-in-a-box) from
[DataKind UK](https://datakind.org.uk/): an intro to setting up a data ethics book club.

## Aims


The aims of the book club, adapted from DataKind UK, are:

1.  To foster discussions of ethics issues among our data science
    community, that we can take back to our day jobs/careers;
2.  To critically evaluate definitions of data for good;
3.  To educate and inform our community on ethical issues, to better
    enable them to advocate for data ethics and data justice within the wider community; and
4.  To strengthen our community of "data for good" enthusiasts.
