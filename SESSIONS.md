# Meeting Dates

Sessions are every one-two months on a **weekday lunchtime** from 12:30-1:30pm.

The dates for upcoming sessions are here, but the discussion material will be voted for in the meeting before. All additional material can be found in the relevant session information document.

An Eventbrite link will be sent out via Slack so that we can keep attendance within a manageable number. We will meet on Microsoft Teams - please contact the organisers via the [Slack Workspace](https://govdatascience.slack.com) if you do not receive an invite.

We aim to add details of 2020 events shortly, in the meantime:

The first three sessions focused on [Data Feminism](https://github.com/ukgovdatascience/data-ethics-and-society-reading-group/tree/main/Sessions/2020/Data_Feminism), centered around [the Data Feminism book](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/) by
Catherine D'Ignazio ([@kanarinka](https://twitter.com/kanarinka)) and Lauren Klein ([@laurenfklein](https://twitter.com/laurenfklein)). If you want to run these sessions a reading list can be seen on our github: [session 1](Sessions/2020/Data_Feminism/Session_1/1_Data-Feminism-Part-1.md), [session 2](Sessions/2020/Data_Feminism/Session_2/2_Reflecting-on-Practice.md), [session 3](Sessions/2020/Data_Feminism/Session_3/3_Data-Feminism-Part-2.md).
