# Reflecting on Data Science Practice

## Discussion prompts

### General discussion prompts
  - General questions might be:
      - What did you think about what you read?
          - What was your favourite idea/passage in the piece?
          - What did you like least?
      - Was there anything that shocked or surprised you?
      - Did this change your perception of data science? Does this
        change public perception of data science?
      - What do you think the author was trying to achieve with the
        book/article?
      - What were the most important points/topics covered?
      - Was there anything you disagreed with, or that struck you as
        controversial?
      - Pick out a quote from the material/book you found particularly
        interesting and be prepared to explain why

### Specific Discussion Prompts:
  - A few ideas of specific points of discussion, based on the material:
      - Do you think we do enough as civil servants, to think critically about
        the data we use, and how we use it?
      - Are data science practitioners in the civil service adequately
        informed and engaged in critical reflection about the nature of their
        practice?
        - Do different kinds of data science roles require different levels of
        engagement in discussions about data ethics?
        - Can an 'engaged' and thoughtful data science practitioner in
          government actually make change?
      - Should we think critically about 'public good' as civil servants?
      - Is working through a lens of intersectional feminism in direct conflict with public sector 'neutrality'?
      - What does it mean for data scientists in the civil service, if Ben Green
      is correct in saying:
          > "if computer science is to productively contribute to creating a
      better society, it must develop a rigorous methodology that considers what
      it means to do good and how to choose among competing goods. This
      requires, first and foremost, a political orientation for algorithmic
      practice.”
      - Ben Green also claims that data practice _is_ political activity:
          > "Whether or not the computer scientists behind this and similar projects
        recognize it, their decisions about what problems to work on, what data
        to use, and what solutions to propose involve normative stances that
      affect the distribution of power, status, and rights across society. They
      are, in other words, engaging in political activity."
        - Is he right?
