# Reading list

(format borrowed from [Data Ethics Club](https://github.com/very-good-science/data-ethics-club))

- üï∞Ô∏è = waiting for paper to drop
- ‚úÖ = we've read it
- üìÖ = planned for an upcoming session
- üì∫ = Watching/Listening material
- <sup>1</sup> = A longer piece of work, we'd need to choose a chapter or section.
- <sup>2</sup> = A shorter piece of work, perhaps to combine with something else

These are rough categories, reading materials appear once in the category we felt they fit best. 
We welcome suggestions for new categories, or moving materials between categories (please [open an issue](https://github.com/ukgovdatascience/data-ethics-and-society-reading-group/issues/new/choose), or [send us a Slack message](https://govdatascience.slack.com/team/UE7T99KTR)).
