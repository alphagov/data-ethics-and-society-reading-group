# Reading list

(format borrowed from [Data Ethics Club](https://github.com/very-good-science/data-ethics-club))

- âœ… = we've read it
- ðŸ“… = planned for an upcoming session
- ðŸ“º = Watching/Listening/Learning material
- ðŸ’¸ = open access material

These are rough categories, reading materials appear once in the category we felt they fit best.
Every session we give the audience a chance to vote on what they want to read next, and suggest new material.

We welcome suggestions for new material at any time. Email us at [xgov-data-ethics@proton.me](mailto:xgov-data-ethics@proton.me).
