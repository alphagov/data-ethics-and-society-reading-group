### Specific Discussion Prompts:
  - A few ideas of specific points of discussion, based on the material:
      - What does data science mean to you? Does the author's description of
      data science differ (see below) from your understanding?
      > “Many people think of data as numbers alone, but data can also consist
      of words or stories, colors or sounds, or any type of information that is
      systematically collected, organized, and analyzed. The science in data science simply implies a commitment to systematic methods of observation
      and experiment.” 
      > “...a capacious definition of data science, one that seeks to include rather than exclude and does not erect barriers based on formal credentials, professional affiliation, size of data, complexity of technical methods, or other external markers of expertise.”
      - Is data is the new oil a useful concept? 
      - Do we feel this book provides “concrete steps to action for data
      scientists seeking to learn how feminism can help them work toward
      justice”?
      - As civil servants can we move from data ethics to data justice? and if
      so how? How can we challenge power as data scientists? 
      - What have been our missed opportunities to work with vulnerable/marginalised groups at work?
      - What does data feminism look like during a pandemic? (e.g. the need for
      gender/race/ethnicity disaggregated data, effect of occupational
      differences (to health and economic stability), caregiving, Data for black lives crowdsourcing getting data on race and ethnicity in the US
