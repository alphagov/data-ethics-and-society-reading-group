We will be discussing [Bad Data: How Governments, Politicians and the Rest of Us Get Misled by Numbers](https://twitter.com/grsturge), by Georgina Sturge:

> Our politicians make vital decisions and declarations every day that rely on official data. But should all statistics be trusted? In Bad Data, House of Commons Library statistician Georgina Sturge draws back the curtain on how governments of the past and present have been led astray by figures littered with inconsistency, guesswork and uncertainty.

Bad Data was chosen based on a poll at our last event, where 62% of people voted for the book.

Please consider either buying the book from a local, independent bookseller, or picking up a used copy online, or borrowing from your local library.
