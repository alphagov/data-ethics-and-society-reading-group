## Description

You're welcome to join us for our next Data Science: Ethics & Society Reading Group on Tuesday 28th February at [12:00](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Bad+Data&iso=20230228T12&p1=136&ah=1). This time we're going to watch/read [Bad Data](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/bad-data-data-ethics-and-society-reading-group-tickets-514972074337) by Georgina Sturge. Sturge, a statistician at the House of Commons Library,  reveals how governments of the past and present have been led astray by figures littered with inconsistency, guesswork and uncertainty.

Thank you to Harriet for suggesting this week's content.

## Discussion points

There will be time to talk about whatever we like, relating to the paper, but here are some specific questions to think about while you're reading.
