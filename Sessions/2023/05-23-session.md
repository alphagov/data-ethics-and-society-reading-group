## Description

You're welcome to join us for our second Data Science: Ethics & Society Reading Group event of 2023 on Wednesday 17th May at 12:00. This time we're going to read [Weapons of Math Destruction](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28186015-weapons-of-math-destruction) by [Cathy O'Neil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathy_O'Neil). O'Neil, a mathematician and data scientist, reveals the mathematical models being used today are unregulated and uncontestable, even when they're wrong.

Weapons of Math Destruction was chosen based on a poll at our last event.

Please consider either buying the book from a local, independent bookseller, or picking up a used copy online, or borrowing from your local library.

## Discussion points

There will be time to talk about whatever we like, relating to the paper, but here are some specific questions to think about while you're reading.
