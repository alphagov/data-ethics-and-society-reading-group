## Description

You're welcome to join us for our next Data Ethics & Society Reading Group on Tuesday the 19th September at [12:00-13:00](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Good+Data-+Data+Ethics+and+Society+Reading+Group&iso=20230919T12&p1=136&ah=1). This time we're going to watch/read [Good Data: An Optimist's Guide to Our Digital Future](https://gooddataguide.com/) by Sam Gilbert, which sheds light on topics such as privacy, consent and algorithmic bias, while offering practical strategies for mitigating the negative impacts and maximizing the positive potential of data-driven technologies.

Thank you to everyone who voted in our last session, where we voted for this content.

## Discussion points

There will be time to talk about whatever we like, relating to the book, but here are some specific questions to think about while you're reading.
