### Specific Discussion Prompts:
A few ideas of specific points of discussion, based on the material:
#### General discussion points for Data Feminism for civil servants:
- Do you agree with the authors' 'expanded' definition of data science?
> "one that seeks to include rather than exclude and does not erect barriers based on  formal  credentials,  professional  affiliation,  size  of  data,  complexity  of  technical  methods,  or  other  external  markers  of  expertise."
- Do you think we do enough as civil servants, to think critically about the data we use, and how we use it?
- Are data science practitioners in the civil service adequately informed and
  engaged in critical reflection about the nature of their practice?
- Can an 'engaged' and thoughtful data science practitioner in government actually make change?
- Should we think critically about 'public good' as civil servants?
- Is working through a lens of intersectional feminism in direct conflict with
  public sector 'neutrality'?
  
#### Specific discussion points for Chapters 6+ of Data Feminism for civil servants:
- Is there 'hidden labour' involved in data science practice in the civil
  service?
- Is the concept of 'technochauvinism', the belief that the technological
  solution to a problem is the right one, useful?
