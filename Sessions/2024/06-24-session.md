## Description

You're welcome to join us for our next Data Ethics & Society Reading Group on Tuesday 4th of June at [13:00 GMT](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Dark+Data&iso=20240604T13&p1=136&ah=1)

This time we're going to read [Dark Data](https://darkdata.website/) by David Hand, which examines the data you donâ€™t have, illustrating with many real-life examples how lack of awareness of what you are missing can lead to distorted understanding, incorrect conclusions, and mistaken actions.

Thank you to everyone who attended our [last session](../2023/02-24-session.md).
