# Data Science: Ethics & Society Reading Group TBD
## Meeting info

### Description

You're welcome to join us for the third of the 2022 Data Science: Ethics & Society Reading Group sessions, on TBD. 

We will be discussing [Caroline Criado Perez's Invisible Women]([https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50489326-counting](https://carolinecriadoperez.com/book/invisible-women/)). _Invisible Women shows us how, in a world largely built for and by men, we are systematically ignoring half the population.  It exposes the gender data gap – a gap in our knowledge that is at the root of perpetual, systemic discrimination against women, and that has created a pervasive but invisible bias with a profound effect on women’s lives._

> Please consider either buying the book from a local, independent bookseller, or picking up a used copy online. 

Thank you to Katy and Annie for suggesting this events content.
