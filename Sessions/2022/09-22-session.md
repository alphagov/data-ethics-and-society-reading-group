## Meeting info

### Description

You're welcome to join us for the third of the 2022 Data Science: Ethics & Society Reading Group sessions, on Tuesday  6th September 2022 at [12:00-13:00](https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?iso=20220531T12&p0=298&msg=Data+Ethics+and+Society+Reading+Group%3A+Counting%3A+How+We+Use+Numbers+to+Decide+What+Matters&ud=1&font=serif). 

We will be discussing [Caroline Criado Perez's Invisible Women](https://carolinecriadoperez.com/book/invisible-women/). _Invisible Women shows us how, in a world largely built for and by men, we are systematically ignoring half the population.  It exposes the gender data gap – a gap in our knowledge that is at the root of perpetual, systemic discrimination against women, and that has created a pervasive but invisible bias with a profound effect on women’s lives._

> Please consider either buying the book from a local, independent bookseller, or picking up a used copy online. 

Thank you to Katy and Annie for suggesting this events content.
