We will be discussing [Artificial Unintelligence: How Computers Misunderstand the World](https://uk.bookshop.org/books/artificial-unintelligence-how-computers-misunderstand-the-world/9780262537018), by Meredith Broussard:

> Making a case against technochauvinism—the belief that technology is always the solution—Broussard, a software developer and journalist, argues that it’s just not true that social problems would inevitably retreat before a digitally enabled Utopia... If we understand the limits of what we can do with technology, Broussard tells us, we can make better choices about what we should do with it to make the world better for everyone.

Thank you to Alessia for suggesting the material.

Please consider either buying the book from a local, independent bookseller, or picking up a used copy online, or borrowing from your local library.

## Discussion points

There will be time to talk about whatever we like, relating to the paper, but here are some specific questions to think about while you're reading.

- How is this book different to _similar_ books you've read before?
- Have you ever encountered _technochauvinism_ in your work?
- How do you think the author's background as a computer scientist and data journalist affects its narrative?
